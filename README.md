# Paint-Application
### **About:**
This is a simple paint application made with the help of Python, using the UI library named tkinter. The modern look is achieved by layering images above tkinter widgets, and a canvas is used to draw the image. Since tkinter lacks a screen capture feature, the save function takes a screenshot, crops the image, and then saves it to a specified directory chosen by the user.

### Modules 
- pyautogui
- tkinter
