# Paint-Application
### **About:**
This project is a simple paint application developed using Python and the tkinter UI library. The application features a modern design by overlaying images on tkinter widgets, and it provides users with a canvas to draw on.

Key Features:
Modern UI Design:
A modern look is achieved by layering images over traditional tkinter widgets, giving the interface a polished appearance.
Canvas Drawing:
The canvas widget is used as the primary drawing area where users can freely paint or sketch.
Save Function:
Since tkinter doesn't natively support capturing screen or canvas images, the save function takes a screenshot of the canvas, crops it, and saves it to a directory specified by the user.
### Modules 
- pyautogui
- tkinter
